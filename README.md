Maschine Local Provisioning
===========================

My personal workstation playbook. Provisions an Arch Linux installation with a KDE Plasma desktop.
It's supposed to be used after the [Arch Installtion Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) is completed, you have setup a working internet connection and have installed `ansible` & `git`.
